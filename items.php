<p style="font-size:25px;font-family:'Gabriola'">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&emsp;      A really great way to help us out is to donate goods to our orphanage (goods in kind). This can be done by collecting together clothes (new or second hand), books, toys, pencils… etc. and then bundle them up in a parcel and send them out to us. We have put together a little list below of some useful and no-so-useful items. Sometimes this can be a little expensive for people so perhaps you could try getting together with a group of friends or colleagues.Over the years we have received plenty of different things in the post, from the ordinary (shoes, watches, clothes) to the extraordinary (a box of honey, coffee plungers, hot water bottles). There is very little that we can’t use.

 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;some people who dont want do these temporary things and have money  they can sponser them for there education.And they are more kind hearted they can also adopt the children. According to me all the donars are not less than Mother Teresa who is very well known for her kind heated in heart.
